"""
Simple tests for verifying software requirements.
These tests will check if the following conditions
are met:

    * Python is 3.0 or higher.
    * TensorFlow is 2.0 or higher.
    * Keras is 2.2 or higher.

The program returns helpful error messages if
the conditions above are not met.abs

Proceed to Chapter 02 when all tests pass.
