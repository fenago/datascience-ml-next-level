## citibike.csv Dataset

Due to GitHub's file upload limits, the `citibike.csv` file used
in this chapter cannot be added to the repo. To download the file,
head to [the official CitiBike website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
Click on "downloadable files of Citi Bike trip data" and find
the .zip file entitled "202006-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip". Download
the file, unzip it, and rename the CSV inside to `citibike.csv`.
Drag `citibike.csv` into this folder and you should be good to go.
The Jupyter Notebook's code will run as expected.
